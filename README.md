The Devnews is a great platform for keeping up with all the latest news in the tech world. Not only does it provide a central place to find information, but it also has a Telegram bot that can deliver news directly to your chat. This makes it easy to stay up-to-date with current upcoming news or articles.

The next js 13 prisma and mongo db were used to build this project's database.
The project scrapes numerous websites, including Medium, dev.to, hashnode, the edge, TechCrunch, and many others, to collect data from them.
